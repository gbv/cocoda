A concept scheme is an organized collection of **concepts** which each indentify an individual object such as a person, a place, or a topic. Most concepts have at least a possibly unique preferred **label**, a unique **notation**, and a globally unique URI.

The left and right pane of cocoda user interface allow browsing in a concept scheme to search, inspect, and select individual concepts. Each concept browser at the left and the right side of the interface consists of:

* a dropdown menu on the top to **select a concept scheme**

* a **search field** to find concepts in a selected scheme by notation or label

* a pane that shows **details** about the selecetd scheme or the selected concept

* a **concept tree** for hierarchical browsing if the selected scheme is a
  classification or taxonomy

A list of bookmarked concept schemes is shown if no concept scheme was selected.

### Details

The details pane shows a scheme's or concept's detailed information. In case of a scheme it currently shows the notation, label, license, publisher, and identifier. It will also show a scheme's top concepts if the tree view is minimized. In case of a concept it currently shows a concept's ancestors, its notation and preferred label, notes (scope notes and editorial notes), register entries and additional labels, identifiers, GND terms, and narrower concepts. In most cases, not all of these informations are available for a concept. The details pane also allows navigating backward and forward through the history of selected concepts by using the arrow buttons in the top right.

### Concept Tree

If the selected scheme supports hierarchical navigation, the concept tree will show the top concepts. Clicking on a concept in the tree view will select the concept and show its details in the detail pane. You can show a concept's narrower concepts by clicking on the arrow beside the concept in the tree. Double clicking a concept will both select it and show its narrower concepts. You can also use the detail pane to browse by clicking on a concept's ancestors (at the top) and narrower concepts (at the bottom).
