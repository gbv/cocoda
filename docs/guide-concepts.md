A **concept** identifies and individual object such as a person, a place, or a topic. Most concepts have at least a possibly unique preferred **label**, a unique **notation**, and a globally unique URI.

The left and right side of Cocoda user interface allow browsing in a concept scheme to search, inspect, and select individual concepts. Each concept browser at the left and the right side of the interface consists of:

* a dropdown menu on the top to **select a concept scheme**

* a **search field** to find concepts in a selected scheme by notation or label

* a card that shows **details** about the selected scheme or the selected concept

* a **concept tree** for hierarchical browsing if the selected scheme is a
  classification or taxonomy

A list of bookmarked concept schemes is shown if no concept scheme was selected.

### Concept Details

### Concept Tree

If the selected scheme supports hierarchical navigation, the concept tree will show the top concepts. Clicking on a concept in the tree view will select the concept and show its details in the detail card. You can show a concept's narrower concepts by clicking on the arrow beside the concept in the tree. Double clicking a concept will both select it and show its narrower concepts. You can also use the detail card to browse by clicking on a concept's ancestors (at the top) and narrower concepts (at the bottom).
