On the settings screen under the tab 'Accounts', click on one of the available login buttons (currently GitHub, ORCID, and VZG LDAP). You will be required to authenticate with the respective service and confirm that you'd like to use your account to log in with our service.

After you logged in, the pages should look like this:

You can now change the registry to save your mappings between 'Local' (your browser) and 'Concordance Registry' (database from the GBV). You can also change your display name and the identity which will be stored in the mappings you save.

By clicking on 'Account Page', you will be forwarded to a separate Login Server page. Here you can inspect your information, add or remove connected accounts, log out, or delete your user account. Deleting your account will immediately remove your data from the database, but already created accounts will still contain your identity information.

When logged in, you will also see either a green icon (see screenshot) or the chosen identity provider's icon next to your name, as well as the registry which is used to save mappings.
