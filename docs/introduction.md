Cocoda is a web application to manage and create **mappings between knowledge organization systems**, such as classifications, authority files, and thesauri. The application is developed as part of [project coli-conc](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/) at [GBV](https://www.gbv.de/), funded [by DFG](http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/276843344).

Public instances of Cocoda are listed at <https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/> with the most recent development version at <https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/dev/>.

This document consists of three chapters:

* read the **[end user manual](#manual)** how to use an existing instance of Cocoda.
  There is also an independent [German user manual](https://gbv.github.io/cocoda/dev/user-manual-de.html).

* read the **[administrator manual](#administration)** how to install and configure Cocoda

* read the **[developer manual](#development)** to understand and extend functionality of Cocoda
