Selecting and browsing a concept scheme is simple. First, select a scheme either from the quick selection or from the full list of schemes at the top. After selecting a scheme, a search field, detail component, and tree view component will be shown. If the scheme supports hierarchical navigation, the tree view will show the top concepts of the scheme. Clicking on a concept in the tree view will select the concept and show its details in the detail component. You can show a concept's narrower concepts by clicking on the arrow beside the concept in the tree. Double clicking a concept will both select it and show its narrower concepts. You can also use the detail component to browse by clicking on a concept's ancestors (at the top) and narrower concepts (at the bottom).

The detail component shows a scheme's or concept's detailed information. In case of a scheme it currently shows the notation, label, license, publisher, and identifier. It will also show a scheme's top concepts if the tree view is minimized. In case of a concept it currently shows a concept's ancestors, its notation and preferred label, notes (scope notes and editorial notes), register entries and additional labels, identifiers, GND terms, and narrower concepts. In most cases, not all of these informations are available for a concept. The detail component also allows navigating backward and forward through the history of selected concepts by using the arrow buttons in the top right.
