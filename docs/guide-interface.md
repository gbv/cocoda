The user interface is divided into several **cards** which can be resized and arranged in different configurations. Most of these cards are implemented as [components](#components) which can also be used in other web applications.

* By default, the left and right side of the interface allow [browsing in concept schemes](#concepts) to inspect and select concepts from source and target vocabulary respectively.

* In between there are several cards to create, modify, browse, and evaluate [mappings and mapping recommendations](#mappings).

All cards can be hidden with a **minimize button** in the top right of each card and resized by dragging on the **divider line** between cards.
