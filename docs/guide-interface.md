The user interface is divided into several **panes** which can be resized and arranged in different configurations. Most of these panes are implemented as [components](#components) which can also be used in other web applications.

* By default, the left and right side of the interface allow [browsing in concept schemes](#concepts) to inspect and select concepts from source and target vocabulary respectively.

* In between there are several panes to create, modify, browse, and evaluate [mappings and mapping recommendations](#mappings).

All panes can be hidden with a **minimize button** in the top right of each pane and resized by dragging on the **divider line** between panes.
