The interface consists of several components than interact with each other but can also be used independently. By default, the left and right side of the interface allow browsing the source and target schemes respectively. On the top you can select a scheme out of all schemes provided by supported terminology providers. After selecting a scheme, you will see three components below:

- A search field to search for concepts by notation or label,
- a detail component that shows a selected scheme's or concept's details like labels, notes, ancester concepts, and narrower concepts,
- and a tree component that allows browsing the scheme in a tree view (if supported by the scheme).

In between the two browsing components, there are currently three components that are related to the mapping aspect of the application:

- A mapping editor that supports creating and editing single mappings between concepts,
- a mapping browser that shows exisiting mappings (currently showing all mappings of concordances listed [here](http://coli-conc.gbv.de/concordances/)),
- and an occurrences browser that shows occurrences and co-occurrences of selected concepts.

All components can be hidden by using the minimizing button in the top right of each component. Additionally, you can adjust the size by dragging on the divider line between components.
