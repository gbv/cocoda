<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This manual gives a brief introduction to the main components of Cocoda. The web application for creating and managing mappings between knowledge organization systems (classifications, standards data, thesauri…) is maintained as part of the <a href="https://coli-conc.gbv.de/">coli-conc project</a> at the <a href="https://en.gbv.de/">Head Office of the GBV Common Library Network (VZG)</a>. Cocoda use cases range from mapping own classifications to more established vocabularies, to creating mappings to improve retrieval in catalogs and discovery systems, to collecting mappings in Wikidata as a central hub for standards data.</p>
<p>Several tutorials, screencasts, and variously configured instances of Cocoda are linked at <a href="https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/" class="uri">https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the current release version: <a href="https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/app/" class="uri">https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/app/</a></li>
<li>the current development version: <a href="https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/dev/" class="uri">https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/dev/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the configuration of the Cocoda instance, some of the features described here may not be available.</p>
<h2 id="user-interface">User Interface</h2>
<p>Firefox or Chromium is recommended as the browser and a screen with at least Full HD resolution (1920×1080). The user interface can be customized via the <a href="#settings">settings</a>; among other things, the language can be changed.</p>
<p>The <strong>menu bar</strong> contains (depending on the configuration):</p>
<ul>
<li>Logo and name of the respective Cocoda instance</li>
<li><img src="img/icons/exchange.svg" style="height:1em" /> Left-right arrows to change the mapping direction</li>
<li>Links to imprint, privacy policy, manual and feedback option</li>
<li><img src="img/icons/trash.svg" style="height:1em" /> Trash can to view and restore last deleted mappings</li>
<li><img src="img/icons/star.svg" style="height:1em" /> Quick selection of remembered concepts</li>
<li><img src="img/icons/user-solid.svg" style="height:1em" /> <a href="#user-accounts">User account</a> and name. After successful login, the username is highlighted in bold and quick selection can be used to change identity for saving <a href="#">mappings</a> and <a href="#">ratings</a></li>
<li><img src="img/icons/gear-solid.svg" style="height:1em" /> <a href="#">Settings</a> with quick selection of the <a href="#">database</a> into which mappings and ratings are saved</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the screen is divided into three areas with several <strong>components</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Components for selecting <a href="#">vocabularies and concepts</a> Left and Right.</li>
<li>Components for selecting, creating, and editing <a href="#">mappings</a> in the middle.</li>
</ul>
<p>When Cocoda is started, initially only the components for <a href="#vocabularies-selection">vocabulary selection</a> are open while general notes are displayed in the center. The size of individual components can be changed with the dots or, the minimize icon hides a component. In addition, some components have icons in the lower right corner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the behavior of the component</li>
<li>Detailed view of the data and sources displayed in a component</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-accounts">User accounts</h2>
<p>In principle, Cocoda does not manage its own user accounts. The <a href="#settings">settings</a> are therefore also only stored in the browser. Existing accounts with external services can be used for login:</p>
<ul>
<li>ORCID</li>
<li>Wikimedia (Wikipedia, Wikidata…)</li>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>StackExchange</li>
<li>LDAP (only VZG internal)</li>
</ul>
<p>These external accounts are called <strong>Identities</strong> in Cocoda. The identity selected in each case and the corresponding username are displayed in the <a href="#user%20interface">menu bar</a> after successful login and can be changed there. Further details can be viewed in the <a href="#preferences">settings</a> under “Account”. Users can decide for themselves whether and with which identity Cocoda stores user contributions for public viewing:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the personal assignment of contributions is not desired, the default identity should be selected. In this case, an account identifier is used whose assignment to identities is only visible to the administrators of the mapping database at VZG. In addition, a pseudonym should be assigned as a name.</li>
<li>If one of the other identities is selected, the user can be publicly identified by the identity URI.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/cocoda-login-select-identity-en.png" class="border border-dark" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>If mappings should not be publicly viewable at all, mappings can also be saved locally in your own browser without login. However, this feature is disabled in some Cocoda instances for the sake of clarity.</p>

Evtl. kurz eräutern, was beim Löschen des Accounts passiert: welche Daten bleiben, welche werden geölscht.

<h2 id="vocabularies-and-concepts">Vocabularies and concepts</h2>
<p>Individual knowledge organization systems are referred to as <strong>concept schemes</strong> or just <strong>schemes</strong>. Concept schemes are also known as ontologies, (controlled) vocabularies, taxonomies, and terminologies. Cocoda provides access to multiple concept schemes from multiple sources.</p>
<p>A concept scheme is an organized collection of <a href="#concepts">concepts</a> and additional information about the concept scheme. Cocoda recommends all concept schemes to be registered in the <a href="https://BARTOC.org">Basel Register of Thesauri, Ontologies &amp; Classifications (BARTOC)</a> and to use its identifiers for to uniquely refer to indivial concept schemes.</p>
<p>To give an example the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) is a concept scheme of type universal library classification, published by OCLC and registered in BARTOC with URI <a href="http://bartoc.org/en/node/241" class="uri">http://bartoc.org/en/node/241</a>.</p>
<h3 id="vocabularies-selection">Vocabularies selection</h3>
<p>The details card shows a scheme’s or concept’s detailed information. In case of a scheme it currently shows the notation, label, license, publisher, and identifier. It will also show a scheme’s top concepts if the tree view is minimized. In case of a concept it currently shows a concept’s ancestors, its notation and preferred label, notes (scope notes and editorial notes), register entries and additional labels, identifiers, GND terms, and narrower concepts. In most cases, not all of these informations are available for a concept.</p>
<p><img src="img/cocoda-classdet-en.png" /></p>
<h3 id="details-of-the-vocabulary">Details of the vocabulary</h3>
<h3 id="search-for-concepts">Search for concepts</h3>
<h3 id="details-of-the-concept">Details of the concept</h3>
<h3 id="tree-view">Tree view</h3>
<h3 id="list-view">List view</h3>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<p>A <strong>concept</strong> identifies and individual object such as a person, a place, or a topic. Most concepts have at least a possibly unique preferred <strong>label</strong>, a unique <strong>notation</strong>, and a globally unique URI.</p>
<p>The left and right side of Cocoda user interface allow browsing in a concept scheme to search, inspect, and select individual concepts. Each concept browser at the left and the right side of the interface consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a dropdown menu on the top to <strong>select a concept scheme</strong></p></li>
<li><p>a <strong>search field</strong> to find concepts in a selected scheme by notation or label</p></li>
<li><p>a card that shows <strong>details</strong> about the selected scheme or the selected concept</p></li>
<li><p>a <strong>concept tree</strong> for hierarchical browsing if the selected scheme is a classification or taxonomy</p></li>
<li><p>A list of bookmarked concept schemes is shown if no concept scheme was selected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="concept-details">Concept Details</h3>
<p><img src="img/cocoda-concdet-en.png" /></p>
<h3 id="concept-tree">Concept Tree</h3>
<p>If the selected scheme supports hierarchical navigation, the concept tree will show the top concepts. Clicking on a concept in the tree view will select the concept and show its details in the detail card. You can show a concept’s narrower concepts by clicking on the arrow beside the concept in the tree. Double clicking a concept will both select it and show its narrower concepts. You can also use the detail card to browse by clicking on a concept’s ancestors (at the top) and narrower concepts (at the bottom). <img src="img/cocoda-conctree-en.png" /></p>
<h2 id="mappings">Mappings</h2>
<p>The central part of the user interface shows multiple cards to create, modify, browse, and evaluate mappings. A <strong>mapping</strong> is a directed connection between one concepts and one or more concepts from another concept scheme (more complex mappings may be supported in a later release).</p>
<p>Mappings can be managed with:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a <strong>mapping editor</strong> to create and modify individual mappings</p></li>
<li><p>a <strong>mapping browser</strong> that lists existing mappings (from local storage or a mapping provider) as well as mapping recommendations (currently occurrences and co-occurrences of selected concepts)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mapping-editor">Mapping Editor</h3>
<p>To add a concept to the mapping, you first have to select the concept (by clicking on it in the tree view, detail view, or anywhere else) and then clicking the plus (+) button on the bottom of the mapping editor (alternatively you can click the (+) button next to the concept in the detail card). You can also quickly add concepts from the tree view by clicking on the small plus button on the right of the concepts. Additionally, you can just drag and drop concepts into the Mapping Editor. In the middle of the mapping editor, you can choose the type of the mapping (exact match, close match, broader match, narrower match, related match, or mapping relation). At the bottom of the card, there are different action buttons for saving a mapping, deleting a mapping, clearing the editor, and exporting the mapping (in that order). The faint background of the card depicts whether the current mapping is saved (green) or not yet saved (red). As of now, you can only save a mapping locally in your browser. In the future, you will be able to authenticate and contribute mappings to a database.</p>
<p><img src="img/cocoda-mappingeditor-en.png" /></p>
<h3 id="mapping-browser">Mapping Browser</h3>
<p>The mapping browser shows existing mappings as well as mapping recommendations for selected concepts from the source and target schemes. At the top of the card, it is possible to select and deselect different sources. Currently available are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local: mappings saved in local storage.</li>
<li>Registry: the Coli-conc registry which contains all mappings listed <a href="http://coli-conc.gbv.de/concordances/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Occurrences: mapping recommendations based on occurrences and co-occurrences of the selected concepts with other concepts from a library catalog. Right now, it takes the data from the <a href="https://gso.gbv.de/">GVK</a>, but in the future it will be possible to choose from several catalogs. Clicking on the number of occurrences will open a link to the catalog.</li>
</ul>
<!--By default, it will show mappings to/from all schemes no matter which scheme is selected on the other side, but you can restrict this by changing the option in the bottom right from "Show All Mappings" to "Show Only Mappings to Selected Scheme". -->
<p>For each mapping or mapping recommendation, there are some available actions on the right of each row: - Edit: saves the mapping or recommendation to local storage and loads it into MappingEditor for editing. - Save: saves the mapping or recommendation to local storage (not available for local mappings or if it’s already in local storage). - Delete: deletes a mapping (currently only available for local mappings).</p>
<h2 id="registries">Registries</h2>
<p>A <strong>registry</strong> is an individual source of data about <a href="#concept-schemes">concept schemes</a>, <a href="#concepts">concepts</a>, <a href="#mappings">mappings</a> etc. An example is the public <a href="http://coli-conc.gbv.de/concordances/">concordance registry</a> with concordances and mappings collected in project coli-conc.</p>
<p>Registries can be configured via the <code>registries</code> field in the <a href="#configuration">configuration</a>. The technical access to data from a registry is implemented via <a href="#providers">providers</a>.</p>
<p>Configured mapping registries can be enabled and disabled in the mapping browser to show or hide their mappings.</p>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>In the settings at the tab ‘Layout’ you can change the handling of the site or the language.</p>
<p><img src="img/cocoda-settings-layout-en.png" /></p>
<p>At the tab ‘Keyboard Shortcuts’ you can check out keyboard-shortcuts</p>
<p><img src="img/cocoda-settings-keysho-en.png" /></p>
<p>At the tab ‘Data Sources’ you can get an overview of all sources of the cocoda-data</p>
<p><img src="img/cocoda-settings-datsor-en.png" /></p>
<p>At the tab ‘Local Mappings’ you can upload, download delete and rewrite the creator of the local mappings (Local Mappings are only saved in your browser).</p>
