## Install

### Release versions

Releases [can be downloaded](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda/releases) in form of static files. Extract into a web server directory and adjust [configuration](#configuration) file `cocoda.json`. You could automate download and extraction of the latest release with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) like this:

```bash
# You can also manually download the latest release here: https://github.com/gbv/cocoda/releases/latest
wget -N $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/gbv/cocoda/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[].browser_download_url')
unzip cocoda-*.zip
rm cocoda-*.zip
```

The directory `cocoda` is then ready to be [served with any web server](#serving-the-files).

### Development versions

Alternatively, it's possible to clone the [Cocoda repository](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gbv/cocoda.git
cd cododa
```

Then install required Node modules with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and run build (requires Node.js v14.15 or above, v16 recommended):

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

Files are created in directory `dist`, including the configuration file.

### Serving the Files

Any web server can be used to serve Cocoda files. No special configuration is necessary. For instance using the `http-server` npm package to server Cocoda at <http://localhost:8000>:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8000 cocoda/     # serve the pre-built release
http-server -p 8000 dist/       # or serve the build version
```

### Docker

Cocoda is also available via Docker. Please refer to [our Docker documentation](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda/blob/dev/docker/README.md) for more information and instructions.

## Usage

There is a detailled end-user manual available [in German](https://gbv.github.io/cocoda/dev/user-manual-de.html) and [in English](https://gbv.github.io/cocoda/dev/user-manual-en.html). The German version will likely be more up-to-date. Documentation sources are located in directory `docs`.

## Configuration

For the pre-built version, configuration options can be overridden by using `cocoda.json` in the root of the directory. The default options are given in the file [`config/cocoda.default.json`](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda/blob/dev/config/cocoda.default.json) (please consult this file for examples on how to use the configuration options). When using a manual build, create file `config/cocoda.json` and rebuild (`npm run build`) after editing (you can also run `npm run build -- --config-only` if you already have a build in folder `dist/` and only need to update the config file). The following fields are recognized so far:

* **title**: the main title of the instance as plain string

* **logos**: a list of logos to display left to the title, each with subfields:
  * `file`: image URL relative to the `static` directory
  * `alt`: alternate text for the image, if the image cannot be displayed, as plain string
  * `url`: URL to link from the logo

* **menu**: a list of links to show in the menu, each with subfields:
  * `url`: the link URL
  * `prefLabel`: mapping of language codes to link titles

* **searchLinks**: a list of search links to quickly link to external resources from concepts. Each searchlink has subfields:
  * `url` an URL template with possible parameters `{prefLabel}` and/or `{notation}`
  * `prefLabel`: mapping of language codes to link titles

* **favoriteSchemes**: list of vocabulary URIs to be favorited by default.

* **languages**: array with supported interface languages

* **registries**: lists [registries](#registries) where to get data from

* **overrideRegistries**: `false` (default) or `true`
  controls whether to override registries listed in `config/cocoda.default.json`

* **auth**: URL to a [login-server](https://github.com/gbv/login-server) instance to be used for authentication

* **conceptLists**: a list of concept lists. Each list can be either an object or a URL that returns a JSON object. Objects are basically [JSKOS registries](http://gbv.github.io/jskos/jskos.html#registries) with required properties `prefLabel` and `concepts`. If `concepts` is a string, it will be considered a URL which returns a JSON array of concepts. Optional properties are `notation` and `scopeNote`.

* **autoRefresh**: an object with auto refresh values in milliseconds. `autoRefresh.mappings` determines how often mappings in MappingBrowser will be reloaded (default: 10000 = every 10 seconds), `autoRefresh.update` determines how often Cocoda will look for an update (default: 120000 = every 2 minutes).

Using the pre-built version, the application only has to be reloaded after editing the configuration file.
